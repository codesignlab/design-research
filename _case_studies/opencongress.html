<small>Case Study</small>
<h1>OpenCongress</h1>

<p>Open Congress, a tool that republishes and adds value to U.S. federal legislative information, it had aged and become a magnificent corpse of ideas and features that needed to be rethought. The team at the Sunlight Foundation were tasked with bringing this tool back in line with the needs and interests of a newly defined user group.</p>
<p>To accomplish this task, the team organized and implemented a human centered design process that included user interviews, affinity diagrams, 'How Might We…?'s, the development of project principals, brainstorming and a set of design principles that would help produce a refined OpenCongress that would meet the needs of actual users.</p>

<h2>Getting introduced to human centered design</h2>
A formal introduction

Human-centered design is a process and set of techniques for finding solutions to problems that the people we're designing for actually have. Our first exploration of a human-centered design approach was with Sitegeist, the product of our Fall 2012 collaboration with IDEO, an international design firm and long-time advocate of human-centered design. Thanks to support from the Knight Foundation, we were able to partner with IDEO to focus our energy in building the third of three mobile "National Data Apps" that would provide a service that people wanted.

We found success in that process. Sitegeist has received multiple design awards (a Bronze medal from IDEA in the Digital Design category and Core77 named Sitegeist a professional notable in their 2013 Design Awards), unexpected and welcome support from the real estate community and continued praise from the U.S. Census Bureau, the source for much of the data. We've found new audiences and reached people in a way that we weren't before. We're embracing that success and look forward to incorporating the human-centered design process into new and existing projects.

 

Test drive

In September, Hilary Hoeber, former IDEO UX designer, led 20 members of our staff through an extensive workshop, introducing staff from throughout Sunlight to the concepts of human-centered design. We stepped outside of the bubble we're normally in and learned to approach a problem face first — and I mean that in the most literal way possible. All of our human-centered design research starts with person-to-person human interaction. We begin with interviews.

Our workshop was centered around an issue that was both new to us, but had a familiar grounding in government affairs and citizen awareness. We were tasked with discovering how we could better prepare citizens for emergencies. We went out in teams and interviewed people that had experiences with and opinions about emergency preparedness. When we returned, Hilary led us through a discovery process in which we iterated through several techniques that helped us to discern themes and identify trends in how people answered questions. As the workshop culminated, we brainstormed solutions to some of the needs that we had identified.

<h2>Preparing for user interviews</h2>
We've taken what we practiced in September and have been applying it to our new work on OpenCongress. We visited Chicago with Hilary to get a perspective from outside the Beltway and spent three intense days conducting user interviews. We continued our interviews in Harrisburg, Penn., Richmond, Va., Charlottesville, Va., and San Francisco.

<h2>Conducting user interviews</h2>

<h2>Creating affinity diagrams through group bucketing activities</h2>
With opinions and passion transferred to sticky notes, we plastered our conference room walls with stories from potential users of OpenCongress. We've bucketed and "rebucketed" them to come up with a series of principles that we're keeping in mind as we brainstorm modifications and new features that will help address the needs that we discovered with the help of our interviewees.

<h2>Posing 'How Might We…?'s</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Development of project principles</h2>
People trust public figures to provide a baseline of understanding
Stories make public policy more compelling
People want interpersonal communication
People are here to solve problems they actually have
Solving problems creates activists
People want to choose from a list of right answers
People are easily overwhelmed by substantial and unfamiliar information
Nuance encourages robust debate
People feel deliberately excluded
Local issues are relatable
