<small>Case Study</small>
<h1>OpenCongress</h1>

<p>Open Congress, a tool that republishes and adds value to U.S. federal legislative information, had aged and become a magnificent corpse of ideas and features that needed to be rethought. The team at the Sunlight Foundation were tasked with bringing this tool back in line with the needs and interests of a newly defined user group.</p>

<p>To accomplish this task, the team organized and implemented a human centered design process that included user interviews, affinity diagrams, 'How Might We…?'s, the development of project principals, brainstorming and a set of design principles that would help produce a refined OpenCongress that would meet the needs of actual users.</p>

<h2>Getting introduced to human centered design</h2>

<p>The team's first exploration in a human-centered design approach was with Sitegeist, the product of a Fall 2012 collaboration with IDEO, an international design firm and long-time advocate of human-centered design. The success of that project (Sitegeist received a Bronze medal from IDEA in the Digital Design category and Core77 named Sitegeist a professional notable in their 2013 Design Awards.) encouraged Sunlight to look at incorporating the human-centered design process into more projects.</p>

<p>To learn how to execute a design research process for themselves, Sunlight engaged in an in house workshop that led 20 members of their staff through an extensive workshop, introducing staff from throughout Sunlight to the concepts of human-centered design. The  workshop was centered around an issue that was new to the team, but had a familiar grounding in government affairs and citizen awareness. The team was tasked with discovering how they could better prepare citizens for emergencies. Small groups went out and interviewed people that had experiences with and opinions about emergency preparedness. They were then led through a discovery process in which they iterated through several techniques (affinity diagrams, how might wes and brainstorming) that helped the groups to discern themes and identify trends in how people answered questions.</p>

<p>At the end of this whirlwind workshop, the core team for OpenCongress took the concepts they learned and applied them to the redesign of the bloated site.</p>

<h2>Preparing for user interviews</h2>

<h3>Identifying users</h3>
<p>The first step for the Sunlight team was to identify who they wanted to speak to and how and where to find them. The identified user group for this project was engaged citizens, a user group who’s needs were not being met by other Sunlight tools. To find these users, it was determined that the interviews should take place outside of the DC beltway, insuring that the interviews didn’t present a skewed sense of engagement. Interviews were ultimately conducted in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Harisburg, PA; Charlottesville, VA; and Richmond, VA.</p>

<h3>Recruiting interview participants</h3>
<p>For this project, the team relied solely on Craigslist to recruit interview participants. There were two craigslist ads posted in each city. The first was looking for people with strong opinions on govt action and the second was looking for people that identified as a voter, volunteer, activist or organizer? Both ads asked for people “with strong opinions and good stories to help us understand what it is you want from government and its leaders”.</p>

[See a sample of the recruiting email.]

<p>Interested parties were collected over the course of a couple of weeks and vetted as best they could be for their potential to generate lots of stories and diverse perspectives.</p>

<h3>Scheduling interviews</h3>

<h2>Conducting user interviews</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Creating affinity diagrams through group bucketing activities</h2>
With opinions and passion transferred to sticky notes, we plastered our conference room walls with stories from potential users of OpenCongress. We've bucketed and "rebucketed" them to come up with a series of principles that we're keeping in mind as we brainstorm modifications and new features that will help address the needs that we discovered with the help of our interviewees.

<h2>Posing 'How Might We…?'s</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>Development of project principles</h2>
People trust public figures to provide a baseline of understanding
Stories make public policy more compelling
People want interpersonal communication
People are here to solve problems they actually have
Solving problems creates activists
People want to choose from a list of right answers
People are easily overwhelmed by substantial and unfamiliar information
Nuance encourages robust debate
People feel deliberately excluded
Local issues are relatable
