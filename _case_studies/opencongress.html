<h1>OpenCongress</h1>
<img src="https://horseradish.s3.amazonaws.com/CACHE/images/photos/42/67/3d20dc9c4690/current-opencongress-800.png">
<p>Open Congress, a tool that republishes and adds value to U.S. federal legislative information, had aged and become a magnificent corpse of ideas and features that needed to be rethought. The team at the Sunlight Foundation was tasked with bringing this tool back in line with the needs and interests of a newly defined user group.</p>

<p>To accomplish this task, we organized and implemented a human centered design process that included user interviews, affinity diagrams, 'How Might We…?'s, the development of project principals, brainstorming and later a set of design principles that would help produce a refined OpenCongress that would meet the needs of actual users.</p>

<h2>Getting introduced to human centered design</h2>

<p>Our first exploration into a human-centered design approach was with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ideo.com/work/sitegeist">Sitegeist</a>, the product of a Fall 2012 collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, an international design firm and long-time advocate of human-centered design. The success of that project (Sitegeist received a Bronze medal from IDEA in the Digital Design category and Core77 named Sitegeist a professional notable in their 2013 Design Awards.) encouraged Sunlight to look at incorporating the human-centered design process into more projects.</p>

<p>To learn how to execute a design research process for ourselves, Sunlight engaged in an in house workshop that led 20 members of the staff through an extensive workshop, introducing staff from throughout Sunlight to the concepts of human-centered design. The  workshop was centered around an issue that was new to the team, but had a familiar grounding in government affairs and citizen awareness. We were tasked with discovering how we might better prepare citizens for emergencies. Small groups went out and interviewed people that had experiences with and opinions about emergency preparedness. We were then led through a discovery process in which we iterated through several techniques (affinity diagrams, how might wes and brainstorming) that helped the groups to discern themes and identify trends in how people answered questions.</p>

<p>At the end of this whirlwind workshop, the core team for OpenCongress took the concepts we had learned began applying them to the redesign of the bloated site.</p>

<h2>Preparing for user interviews</h2>

<h3>Identifying users</h3>
<p>The first step was to identify who we wanted to speak to and how and where to find them. The identified user group for this project was engaged citizens, a user group who’s needs were not being met by other Sunlight tools. To find these users, we determined that the interviews should take place outside of the DC beltway, insuring that the interviews didn’t present a skewed sense of engagement. Interviews were ultimately conducted in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Harisburg, PA; Charlottesville, VA; Richmond, VA; and San Francisco, CA.</p>

<p>We started in Chicago. The Chicago interviews were extremely rich and diverse. We spoke to immigrants with personal stories of opression that led them to migrate to America, staying engaged with global politics. We spoke with ESL citizens that were struggling to navigate the websites provided by local, state and federal government agancies. We spoke with several people that were so frustrated by the corruption of Chicago politics that were planning on running for local Aldermand positions. And we spoke to people who's family had been through personal trama that lead to their civic education as a Chicago citizen, ignited their interest in activism and politics.</p> 

<p>However, we also learned a lot about the astonishing corruption of Chicago politics and the huge influence of Chicago politics on state level issues. While fascinating, it also felt like an anomily that may not be representative of citizen engagement with government as a whole. To combat this bias, we followed up by conducting interviews in smaller cities, primarily in the DC area.

	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>Had we had more time and resources, it would have been helpful to add another layer of diversity to our interviews by targetting a city in an rural agricultural state, where state level legislation impacts citizens as much as local politics.</p>
</aside>

<h3>Recruiting interview participants</h3>
<p>For this project, we relied solely on Craigslist to recruit interview participants. There were two craigslist ads posted in each city. The first was looking for people with strong opinions on govt action and the second was looking for people that identified as a voter, volunteer, activist or organizer. Both ads asked for people “with strong opinions and good stories to help us understand what it is you want from government and its leaders”.</p>

[See a sample of the recruiting email.]

<p>Interested parties were collected over the course of a couple of weeks and vetted as best they could be for their potential to generate lots of stories and diverse perspectives.</p>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>Recruiting is weird and craisglist is too. We chose that platform because it was eay for us to use and was the platform that was used in the workshop that we participated in. People that will reply to craigslist ads that offer an unspecified sum of money as compensation and are willing to welcome you into their homes are willing to take a certain amount of risk that is probably not representative of all demographics. That's fine, but we considered that worth keeping in mind as we analyzed the results of our interviews.</p>
</aside>

<h3>Scheduling interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews were scheduled over email via a shared email account and details about individuals were collected in a shared spreadsheet. All interviews were scheduled in the individuals home or office, if possible. In cases where the interviewee felt uncomfortable with that scenario, we asked them to select a coffeeshop, restaurant or other public space that they felt comfortable in. On a few occasions the scheduler began to feel uncomfortable with the direction of the emails. In these cases, the interview was also moved to a more public location or it was canceled entirely.</p>

<p>Each person participating in conducting an interview was scheduled to conduct no more than three interviews per day. The travel time between each interview location ate up a lot of time. In the case of Chicago, this was particularly true and was exacerbated by traffic, requiring additional time to make sure that we weren't late.</p>


<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>Staying fully engaged in highly personal conversations with new people is mentally exhausting. On days that had three interviews, the quality of the third interview suffered.</p>
	<p>After conducting a half dozen interviews, we began to lose track of which name went with which person. A key piece of advice that we all forgot to act on, was to take a photo of each interviewee in their space. Months later when we were trying to retell stories and share the intamcy of those moments with new team members, we really regretted neglecting to take photos. In truth, I remember considering it on a few occasions and feeling like that was more intrusive than I was confmoratble with, but I would push through that discomfort next time.</p>
</aside>

<h2>Conducting user interviews</h2>
<p>Interviews were conducted by two people at a time. One person was the interview lead and the other was a dedicated notetaker. Not having to worry about taking notes allowed the interview lead to remain engaged with the conversation. The notetaker would occasionally pipe in with a follow up question.</p>

<p>The interview lead would introduce themself, give an overview of how the interview would go and a brief description of the project goals. It was important to provide some context for the interview, but it was equally important to keep the description of the project somewhat vague to try and keep answers as honest and personal as possible.</p>

<p>The interviewee was asked to introduce themselves, describing their background and interest in the interview. They were prompted by the interview lead only when necessary and prompts were crafted to encourage the direction of conversation as much as possible. The team had developed a list of questions that could feed the conversation if necessary, but interviews were more successful if that list of questions was kept to the side.</p>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>These interviews were powerful and fascinating, but not without their moments of discomfort. During one interview, we observed unexpected nazi perafanalia at the desk of the interviewee and during another we were called out by the interviewee on the minority status of each of us. (Couched in an apology, but none the less...)</p>
</aside>

<h3>Wrapping up the interview</h3>
<p>At the end of the interviews, the notetaker would often have dozens of pages of notes. It was important to go over these notes as a group as soon as possible. Both people that conducted the interview transfered the most salient points to sticky notes and then talked the rest of the interview team through them. These sticky notes were collected for each interviewee for future use.</p>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>Retelling the stories shortly after condusting the interviews was a very good way to make sure the most compelling stories were remember and noted. It was also really interesting to hear the unique things that were remembered by one, but not both of the people conducting the interview.</p>

<h2>Creating affinity diagrams through group bucketing activities</h2>

<img src="https://horseradish.s3.amazonaws.com/CACHE/images/photos/7d/d0/fc04a1ff488c/designresearch-800.png">

<p>With opinions and passion transferred to sticky notes, we plastered our conference room walls with stories from the potential users of OpenCongress. We bucketed and "rebucketed" them to come up with a series of principles that we're keeping in mind as we brainstorm modifications and new features that will help address the needs that we discovered with the help of our interviewees.</p>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>It's beautiful and makes everyone feel very productive! It was also and endless task. None of us felt comfortable or familiar enough with the project to judge how we were doing, to push us to be more concrete, or tell us that enough was enough. The process was invirgorating at moments, but it was also exhausting.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Development of project principles</h2>
<p>The result that we finally came to from our affinity diagrams was a list of guiding principles for the redesign of OpenCongress. These were meant to act as our anchor. As we posed ideas and began developing solutions, we checked them against this list to make sure that we were still building solutions that addressed these principles.</p>
<ul>
	<li>People trust public figures to provide a baseline of understanding</li>
	<li>Stories make public policy more compelling</li>
	<li>People want interpersonal communication</li>
	<li>People are here to solve problems they actually have</li>
	<li>Solving problems creates activists</li>
	<li>People want to choose from a list of right answers</li>
	<li>People are easily overwhelmed by substantial and unfamiliar information</li>
	<li>Nuance encourages robust debate</li>
	<li>People feel deliberately excluded</li>
	<li>Local issues are relatable</li>
</ul>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>It was really hard to get to this point. I'm still not sure if the amount of effort we put into the process was too much or too little. We were all so intimately embedded in the content by the time we got to this point in the process that there were moments where we would debate a single word in a phrase for a half hour.</p> 
	<p>The phrase, 'People are here to solve problems they actually have' was particularly contentious. On the one hand it felt like a badly worded principle to stick the word 'actually' in there. Certainly there is a better word than actually. Was it even necessary? Maybe 'People are here to solve problems they have' is enough. But on the other hand, when we took it out, the significance of that principle was completely lost. The people we spoke with had real issues that were affecting them in a real way on a daily basis and dealing with those problems was what brought them into our space.</p>
</aside>

<h2>Posing 'How Might We…?'s</h2>
<p>From the list of principles, and pulling from some of the themes and resonating anecdotes, we posed 'How might we...?' (HMWs) questions that addressed elements of those themes. (e.g. How might we make issues at the federal level of government seem local?) This phase of the process was meant to help identify actionable problems that could be addressed, without getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to solutions and ideas.</p>
<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p></p>
</aside>

<h2>Brainstorming and a set of design principles</h2>
<p>For brainstorming, we brought in extra staff that could provide fresh perspective. We dot voted (with stars!) on the dozens of HMWs that we'd collected and slected a half dozen to brainstorm on. Our project was constrained to a web solution and there were certain elements of the existing site that would need to be included in a new version, but tried to keep things as open as possible.</p>

<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>Some people have great ideas, but don't write them down. Some people write the ideas down and then don't share them. There was a certain amount of prodding involved in making sure everyone participated and that all of the ideas that were voiced were captured.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Design Principles</h2>
<p>[Olivia, will you write why and how you developed these?]</p>
<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p></p>
</aside>
<h2>Knowledge transfer</h2>
<p>Part way through this project, our development team all took new jobs. They had been intimately involved in the entire process and in some cases were better at articulating our ultimate vision than the design team. We eventually onboarded a new team, walking them through our process as best we could. We shared the guiding principles and told stories from the interviews to give a sense of their origin.
<aside style="padding: 20px; background: #eeeeee;">
	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>This was really hard. In an ideal world, you just shouldn't have to deal with that big of a turnover in your team, but as insurance, document everything! When we started this project, the workshop was our only baseline for what this would look like. I had no idea how long of a process it would be or how much content we would produce. In retrospect I would have done these things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Taken a photo of the aggregated sticky notes for each individual.</li>
		<li>Written a brief bio about each individual</li>
		<li>Taken a photo of each individual</li>
		<li>Photographed and documented the themes that resulted from our affinity diagram</li>
		<li>Photographed and documented all of the HMWs</li>
		<li>Taken more photos of the team at work</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Belated development of personas</h2>

	<h4>What we learned</h4>
	<p>[Olivia, will you write why and how you developed these?]</p>

<h2>This project could have been improved with...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Better documentation</li>
	<li>More variation in techniques for analyzing information and generating ideas</li>
	<li>A better understanding of stakeholder needs</li>
</ul>
<small>
	<p>This project was ultimately halted to refocus Sunlight's tools to better serve the community of users that they already have, rather than diversifying to a new audience.</p>
