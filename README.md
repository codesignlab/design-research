#Design Research Is
Designresearch.is is an open collection of design research techniques and case studies.

## Usage

### Setup
This site is built on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

1. Clone this project.
2. Install the jekyll gem if you don't already have it. In terminal, run:
```
$ gem install jekyll
```

### Serve
1. Start a jekyll server to serve up the site. In terminal, from this project's root directory, run:
```
$ jekyll serve
```

2. Open `localhost:4000` in your browser.


## Development
Design Research has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

Use `master` for development. All pull requests should be submitted against master.
We use `gh-pages` for our hosted site. Avoid using this branch.
