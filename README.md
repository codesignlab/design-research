# Design Research

Documenting our design research processes for the present and the future

## Overview
We conduct design research in order to solve for a lack of information and to answer questions. Research ensures that our design choices and other decision-making are informed by qualitative and quantitative data.

We might already conduct informal research of sorts, but by following a methodical process, we make sure that time and resources are spent on work that address requirements and answer the needs of users.

Research approaches will vary from project to project, but will always follow a process for systematic inquiry. It may feel like a lot of upfront work with a steep learning curve, but it'll get easier as we continue to incorporate research into our projects and internalize the process.
