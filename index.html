    <p><strong>Design research</strong> is the deliberate process of asking the right people the right questions to ensure that we are creating solutions with empathy for real users.</p>
    <p>We conduct design research in order to solve for a lack of information and to answer questions. Research ensures our design choices and other decision-making are informed by qualitative data instead of assumptions.</p>
